Validating the correctness of an arithmetic expression is a fundamental task in computer science and is often done using a data structure called a stack. The stack data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, allowing elements to be added or removed from the top of the stack.
To check the validity of an arithmetic expression (infix notation) using a stack, you can follow these steps:
Initialize an empty stack: Start with an empty stack that will be used to store opening parentheses, operators, and other characters encountered in the expression.
Iterate through the expression from left to right: Process each character in the arithmetic expression one by one.
When an opening parenthesis or operator is encountered, push it onto the stack: If the character is '(', '{', or '[', push it onto the stack. If it is an operator (+, -, *, /, etc.), push it onto the stack.
When a closing parenthesis is encountered, check the stack: If the stack is empty, or the top of the stack does not match the current closing parenthesis, the expression is not valid. If the stack is not empty and the top element is the corresponding opening parenthesis, pop the element from the stack.
After processing the entire expression, the stack should be empty: If there are still elements left in the stack, the expression is not valid as it contains unmatched opening parentheses.
By following these steps and appropriately using the stack data structure, you can efficiently validate the validity of an arithmetic expression. This approach ensures that opening and closing parentheses are balanced and nested correctly, and operators are used in a syntactically valid manner. Stack-based validity checking is widely used in compilers, calculators, and various software applications where arithmetic expressions need to be processed and evaluated.
